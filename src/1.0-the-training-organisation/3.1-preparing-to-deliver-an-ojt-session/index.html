        <p>When preparing yourself to deliver an OJT session, there are some basic principles that should help your <strong>preparation</strong>. Trainees will have more confidence in you as an instructor if you are demonstrating that you have taken the time to understand where they are in their training and the <strong>support</strong> that they need from you.</p>

        <p class="mb-0">Watch the following video as Dragan prepares himself for an instructing session:</p>

      <div class="ians-column">

        <p>Here is a summary of the four points made in the video of how you go about preparing yourself:</p>

      </div>

      <div class="ians-column-wide-2">
        <ol class="oj-list-blocks ians-grid-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Who</strong> is the trainee?</li>
          <li>Read the trainee's <strong>report</strong>. If you are the first OJTI, look at her/his reports from pre-OJTI.</li>
          <li>What is to be done? <strong>Training objectives</strong> appropriately selected (UTP &amp; Reports).</li>
          <li>Prepare to explain and overcome reported <strong>weaknesses</strong>.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>

      <div class="ians-column">

        <p>And remember to be fully <strong>committed</strong> to your instructing role. This is vital. As a new OJTI, you may not appreciate how much energy and effort is required to be an effective instructor. We are all human and have good days and bad days, and so we all need to be honest and ask ourselves, "<strong>Am I really up for training today?</strong>" A half-hearted approach to your trainee's session could seriously damage the OJTI/Student relationship and, more critically, set the trainee back in their progress.</p>
